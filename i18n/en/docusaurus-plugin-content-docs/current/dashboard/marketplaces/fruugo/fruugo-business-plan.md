After **category matching, attribute matching, product content and price adjustments** are made for *Fruugo*, you can set ***relevant business plans*** *Manually/Automatically* on the **Settings > Stores > Joom > Business Plan** page. You need to specify and activate it.

## Settings > Business Plan

After doing this, the "**Send Products to Marketplace**" business plan under the Fruugo tab under **Settings > Business Plan** is run with the run button with *side triangle symbol*. After this business plan is completed, the “**Marketplace Stock/Price Update**” business plan is run in the same way.
