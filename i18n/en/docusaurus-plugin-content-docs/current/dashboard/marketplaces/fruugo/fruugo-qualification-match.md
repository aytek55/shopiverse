# Fruugo Attribute Matching

## Attribute Matching

After *category matching* is completed, the **Products > Platform Matching > Attribute Matching** page opens. Joom is selected from the Store area and color and size information with attribute values are listed below.

We open the attribute matching page with the edit button on the right side of the relevant attribute value. On the page opened with the **edit** button corresponding to the **Attribute Value** field here, the values are reset with the "**Clear**" button and the appropriate one is selected from the attribute value equivalents offered by the platform by clicking "**Search**". If the attribute value you want is not available, you can make the matching by entering freetext information in the "Platform Attribute Value" field and clicking Select and Save, and this must be done for each attribute value.
