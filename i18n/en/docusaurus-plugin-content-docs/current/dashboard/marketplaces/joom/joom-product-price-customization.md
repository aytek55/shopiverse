After completing this process, you can update your price information and currency on Excel by clicking *Download Template* from the **Excel Transactions > Store Product Excel** section under the Products page and upload your Excel from the same area. It is important to enter product measurement information correctly in the product contents. According to this information, Joom determines the sales price by subtracting a shipping cost and adding the shipping cost to the sales price you set for the product.
