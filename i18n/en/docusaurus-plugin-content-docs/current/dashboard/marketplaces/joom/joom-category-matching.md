After selecting the category, your products and value fields requested by the platform are listed below on the basis of the Main Product Code. In order for your products to be available for sale, you must fill in the "Mandatory" values for each Main Product Code. After filling in these fields, we complete the category matching in all categories and products by clicking save.
