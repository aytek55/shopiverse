We open the attribute matching page with the **edit** button on the right side of the relevant attribute value.

On the page opened with the edit button corresponding to the Attribute Value field here, reset the values with the "**Clear**" button and say "**Search**" and select the appropriate value from the corresponding attribute value offered by the platform, and this is done for each attribute value.
