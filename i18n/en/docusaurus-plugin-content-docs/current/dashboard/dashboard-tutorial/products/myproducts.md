The processes in the **Supplier Product Excel** tab are used to make changes to the supplier product information.

The transactions in the **Store Product Excel** tab are used to make changes to the product information added to the store. The changes made here do not affect the supplier information, but the store product information is the priority when sending products to the platforms.
